# Trikot.streams

Elegant implementation of ReactiveStreams for Kotlin Multiplatform.

- Multithread support with ObserveOn and SubscribeOn processors
- Simplify the management of publishers subscriptions and unsubscriptions
- Help you focus on what you need to do by hiding Multiplatform complexity

## Sample

#### Common code

```kotlin
class SearchController() {
    private val searchKeywordPublisher = Publishers.behaviorSubject<String>("keyword")
    private val searchResultsPublisher = searchKeywordPublisher.switchMap { keyword ->
        searchService.search(keyword)
    }.shared()
    val searchResultCount = searchResultsPublisher.switchMap { results ->
        PublisherFactory.create(results.count).toString()
    }
    val resultUppercaseTitles = searchResultsPublisher.map { it.title.toUpperCase() }
    val searchResultCountLabel = searchResultsPublisher.map { "${it.results.count()} results" }
    fun searchFor(keyword: String) {
       searchKeywordPublisher.value = keyword
    }
}
```

#### Swift

See [swift extensions](./swift-extensions/README.md) for more information.

Helps connect a publisher to a variable in a reactive environment.

```kotlin
let label = UILabel()
label.bind(searchController.searchResultCountLabel, \UILabel.text)
```

#### Android

See [android-ktx](./android-ktx/README.md) for more information.

Binding helpers relies on AndroidViewModel and uses lifecycleOwner to manage subscription and unsubscription.

```kotlin
val searchResultLiveData = searchController.searchResultCountLabel.asLiveData()
```

## [Publishers and Processors](./documentation/PUBLISHERS.md)

Foundation of trikot.streams is based on a immutable and concurrent implementation of [Reactive-Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/).

## [Cancellables](./documentation/CANCELLABLE.md)

Subscription and unsubscription are managed trough `Cancellable` and `CancellableManager`.
